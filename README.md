CS320 Module 8

How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
Security and functionality are critical to code creation. By utilizing tools like Maven and Junit testing, you can mitigate the vulnerabilities in your software.
Before you can do that, you have to actually create the code and always check things like input validation.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
By asking the proper questions or finding the right answers. Having a firm grasp of requirements and incorporating them into your code can ensure your product is completed to the client's expectations without using too many resources. 

How do I approach designing software?
I start with the larger objectives and work my way down to the smaller portions. Ensuring the main functionality is working properly before working towards less important preferences.
